self.view.addSubview(slideSwitch)
slideSwitch.setOnWithAnimate()
```
### How to get the status of the switch

```
### How to turn on/off switch without animation

slideSwitch.setOff()
```

slideSwitch.setOffWithAnimate()
```
## Requirements
iOS8.0 and above
## About the use of the control background
The switch in the homekit is large, up and down, moving elegantly and accurately judged. It is very suitable for a single switch with only one single page. It is impressive.
